# AI Digest Prompt Optimization Guide

## Current Prompt Architecture

Your prompt follows a highly effective structure:

1. **Persona Definition**: "You're writing for Bhekani - senior engineer, indie hacker"
2. **Analysis First**: Chain-of-thought reasoning before generation
3. **Structured Output**: Clear sections with specific requirements
4. **Examples**: Good vs bad outputs for guidance
5. **Constraints**: "BE BASED" section with clear do's and don'ts

## What's Working Well

### 1. Direct, Action-Oriented Language

```
Good: "Ship CoT prompting in your app this week"
Bad: "Consider exploring chain-of-thought methodologies"
```

This contrast training is excellent for getting practical outputs.

### 2. Time-Bound Actions

- "TODAY", "THIS WEEK", "1-2 days"
- Creates urgency and filters out vague suggestions

### 3. Anti-Patterns

Your "NO" list effectively prevents corporate speak:

- "Exciting developments" ❌
- "Promising technology" ❌
- "Worth monitoring" ❌

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Context Injection

```typescript
// Add to prompt based on previous digests
const recentThemes = getLastNDigests(4).flatMap((d) => d.keyThemes);
prompt += `\nAVOID REHASHING THESE RECENT THEMES: ${recentThemes.join(", ")}`;
```

### 2. Seasonal Awareness

```typescript
const quarter = getCurrentQuarter();
const seasonalContext = {
  Q1: "Focus on new year trends, funding announcements",
  Q2: "Conference season - highlight new demos/launches",
  Q3: "Summer slowdown - dig deeper into research papers",
  Q4: "Year-end roundups, planning for next year",
};
prompt += `\nSEASONAL CONTEXT: ${seasonalContext[quarter]}`;
```

### 3. Personalization Through Usage

```typescript
// Track which sections get clicked/shared
const engagement = await getEngagementMetrics();
if (engagement.productPlays > engagement.rolePlay) {
  prompt +=
    "\nEMPHASIS: User engages most with product plays - make them extra specific";
}
```

### 4. Source-Specific Instructions

```typescript
const sourceInstructions = {
  "openai.com": "Official announcement - look for API/developer implications",
  "arxiv.org":
    "Research paper - extract practical applications, not just theory",
  "techcrunch.com": "News site - verify claims, look for hype vs reality",
};
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. Iterative Refinement

Track these metrics weekly:

- **Actionability Score**: How many suggestions could you implement?
- **Accuracy Score**: How many "breakthroughs" were actually hype?
- **Relevance Score**: How many items directly impact your products?

### 2. A/B Testing Prompts

```typescript
const promptVariants = {
  A: currentPrompt,
  B:
    currentPrompt +
    "\nPRIORITIZE: Technical implementations over business news",
};
// Alternate weekly and compare engagement
```

### 3. Feedback Loop Implementation

```typescript
// Add to digest email
const feedbackPrompt = `
LAST WEEK'S FEEDBACK:
- Most useful: ${feedback.mostUseful}
- Least useful: ${feedback.leastUseful}
- Missing coverage: ${feedback.missing}

Adjust this week's analysis accordingly.
`;
```

## Specific Improvements to Try

### 1. Industry-Specific Threads

```
TRACK THESE STORYLINES:
- OpenAI vs Anthropic rivalry → Who's winning on features?
- Open source vs closed models → Where's the momentum?
- AI coding tools evolution → What's replacing Copilot?
```

### 2. Quantified Impact

```
For each takeaway, add:
- Implementation effort: 🟢 <2hrs | 🟡 2-8hrs | 🔴 >8hrs
- Revenue potential: 💰 (low) | 💰💰 (medium) | 💰💰💰 (high)
- User impact: 👤 (power users) | 👥 (some) | 👥👥👥 (all)
```

### 3. Cross-Reference Your Products

```
For EVERY major development, explicitly state:
"This relates to [Your App] because..."
"Ignore this for [Your App] because..."
```

## Experimental Techniques

### 1. Adversarial Prompting

```
After main analysis add:
"Now argue the OPPOSITE: Why might these developments NOT matter?"
```

### 2. Future Prediction

```
"Based on this week's news, predict what will be announced next week"
(Track accuracy to calibrate the AI's judgment)
```

### 3. Competitive Simulation

```
"If you were competitor X, how would you respond to this week's developments?"
```

## Monitoring Prompt Degradation

Watch for these signs:

1. **Increasing generic language**: The AI reverts to corporate speak
2. **Missing obvious news**: Major announcements aren't highlighted
3. **False patterns**: Connecting unrelated events incorrectly

### Remediation:

- Add more recent examples
- Increase negative examples ("never say X")
- Adjust temperature if available

## Cost-Optimal Prompting

### Current Costs (Approximate)

- Input: ~2000 tokens per digest @ $0.01/1K = $0.02
- Output: ~2000 tokens per digest @ $0.03/1K = $0.06
- Total: ~$0.08 per digest

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Pre-filter emails**: Better AI detection = fewer emails to process
2. **Hierarchical summarization**: Summarize in batches, then summarize summaries
3. **Caching repeated content**: Some newsletters repeat content weekly

## Future Prompt Ideas

### 1. Multi-Week Analysis

```
"Compare this week to the last 4 weeks:
- What narrative is building?
- What hype is dying?
- What's surprisingly persistent?"
```

### 2. Founder-Specific Intel

```
"As an indie hacker with these specific apps [list],
what feature could I ship Monday morning based on this week's news?"
```

### 3. Anti-FOMO Filter

```
"Which of these developments can I safely IGNORE without falling behind?"
```

## Maintenance Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review output quality, note any degradation
- **Monthly**: A/B test prompt variations
- **Quarterly**: Major prompt overhaul based on accumulated feedback
- **Annually**: Review and update source quality scores

Remember: The best prompt is one that evolves with your needs. Track what works, discard what doesn't, and always optimize for actionability over comprehensiveness.
