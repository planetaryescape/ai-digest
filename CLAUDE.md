# AI Digest Codebase Overview

## üöÄ INDIE DEVELOPER CONTEXT
**This is an indie SaaS project focused on rapid market validation.**
- Target: Tens of thousands of users (not millions)
- Philosophy: Ship fast, validate, iterate
- Priority: Working features over perfect code
- Stage: Personal automation tool with SaaS potential

## üí∞ THE MONEY FEATURE
**CRITICAL: This is what users pay for and MUST work perfectly**

**Core Value**: Automated weekly digest that transforms overwhelming AI/tech newsletters into actionable insights
- **What it does**: Fetches Gmail ‚Üí Classifies AI content ‚Üí Extracts articles ‚Üí Analyzes with GPT ‚Üí Sends beautiful digest
- **Why people pay**: Saves 2-3 hours/week of newsletter reading, provides role-specific advice
- **Critical path**: Gmail fetch ‚Üí OpenAI analysis ‚Üí Email delivery
- **Key files**:
  - `functions/core/digest-processor.ts` - Main orchestrator (595 lines)
  - `functions/lib/agents/AnalysisAgent.ts` - Core value generation
  - `functions/lib/email.ts` - Digest delivery
- **Dependencies**: Gmail API, OpenAI GPT-4o/5, Resend for email
- **Failure impact**: No digest = no value = angry users

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repo>
cd ai-digest
bun install

# 2. Generate Gmail OAuth token
bun run generate:oauth

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add: Gmail OAuth, OpenAI API key, Resend API key

# 4. Deploy to AWS
bun run deploy:aws

# 5. Test it
curl https://your-function-url/run-now
```

**That's it!** You're processing emails in < 5 minutes.

## Architecture Overview

**Simple monolithic serverless design** - Perfect for indie SaaS:

```
Gmail ‚Üí Lambda Functions ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Beautiful Email
         ‚Üì
      DynamoDB (tracking)
```

**6-Agent Pipeline** (each specialized):
1. **EmailFetcher**: Smart Gmail fetching (70% API reduction)
2. **Classifier**: Batch AI/non-AI classification
3. **ContentExtractor**: Article extraction via Firecrawl
4. **Research**: Web enrichment via Brave Search
5. **Analysis**: Deep GPT-4o/5 analysis (THE MONEY STEP)
6. **Critic**: Opinionated commentary

**Resilience Built-in**:
- Circuit breakers on all external APIs
- Hard cost limit ($1/run default)
- Graceful degradation when services fail

## Development Guidelines

### Priority Order
1. **Fix anything that breaks email analysis** - This is the money feature
2. **Fix digest delivery issues** - Users must get their emails
3. **Fix cost overruns** - Keep it profitable
4. **Ship user-requested features** - Grow the product
5. **Improve test coverage** - Currently 11% (8 failing tests)
6. Everything else is optional

### What to Ignore
- Microservices architecture (monolith works fine)
- Perfect test coverage (ship features instead)
- Complex CI/CD (simple deploy script works)
- Scaling to millions (worry at 10K users)
- Minor TypeScript errors (20 remaining, not critical)

## üî• REAL PROBLEMS TO FIX

### Critical Issues (Fix This Week)
1. **No secrets management** - API keys in env vars (HIGH RISK)
   - Solution: Add AWS Secrets Manager ($1/month)
   - Files: `functions/lib/aws/secrets-loader.ts`

2. **Failing tests** - 8 core tests broken
   - Solution: Fix digest-processor mocks
   - Files: `functions/core/digest-processor.test.ts`

3. **No API authentication** - Frontend routes unprotected
   - Issue: Clerk auth exists but incomplete
   - Files: `frontend/app/api/*/route.ts`

### Important Issues (Fix This Month)
1. **TypeScript errors** - 20 compilation errors
   - Mostly Result type and missing properties
   - Files: Check `bun run typecheck`

2. **No backups** - DynamoDB data unprotected
   - Solution: Enable point-in-time recovery
   - Cost: ~$0.20/GB/month

3. **Incomplete frontend** - Dashboard half-built
   - Missing: Sender management, execution history
   - Path: `frontend/app/dashboard/`

### Technical Debt (Clean Up Later)
1. **~1,801 lines of reinvented wheels**:
   - Custom circuit breaker ‚Üí Use `opossum` library
   - Custom Result type ‚Üí Use `neverthrow`
   - Custom cost tracker ‚Üí Use `rate-limiter-flexible`

2. **Inconsistent error handling**
   - Some async/await, some promises
   - Mix of Result pattern and try/catch

## üí° Quick Wins (Ship These Features)

### High Impact, Low Effort
1. **Add webhook notifications** (1 day)
   - Slack/Discord when digest sent
   - Simple POST to webhook URL

2. **Email preview mode** (2 hours)
   - Test digests without sending
   - Add `?preview=true` parameter

3. **Sender whitelist UI** (4 hours)
   - Let users mark favorite newsletters
   - Frontend already scaffolded

4. **Cost dashboard** (2 hours)
   - Show API costs per run
   - Data already tracked

### Medium Effort, High Value
1. **Multi-user support** (1 week)
   - Add user accounts to DynamoDB
   - Scope digests per user
   - Charge $5/month

2. **Custom digest schedules** (3 days)
   - Daily/weekly/monthly options
   - EventBridge rules per user

3. **Digest history** (2 days)
   - Store digests in S3
   - Browse past summaries

## Tech Stack & Services

### Key Files to Know
```
functions/
  core/digest-processor.ts      # Main brain - orchestrates everything
  lib/agents/*.ts               # 6 specialized agents
  lib/cost-tracker.ts          # Prevents bankruptcy
  lib/circuit-breaker-enhanced.ts # Resilience
  handlers/aws/run-now.ts      # Manual trigger endpoint

terraform/aws/main.tf          # Infrastructure as code
emails/WeeklyDigestRedesigned.tsx # Beautiful email template
frontend/app/api/             # API routes (needs auth!)
```

## Deployment & Operations

### Deploy Commands
```bash
# Full deploy with infrastructure
bun run deploy:aws

# Quick code update (no Terraform)
bun run update:aws

# Test locally
bun run functions/handlers/aws/run-now.ts
```

### Lambda Functions
| Function | Timeout | Purpose | Trigger |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| run-now | 5 min | Manual digest | API/Dashboard |
| weekly-digest | 15 min | Scheduled + cleanup | EventBridge Sunday 8am |

### Cost Controls
- **Hard limit**: $1/run (adjustable via `MAX_COST_PER_RUN`)
- **Email limit**: 500/run
- **OpenAI calls**: 50/run
- **Typical cost**: $0.10/digest

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/ai-digest-run-now --follow

# Check costs
# Visit Helicone dashboard

# Check errors
# CloudWatch Insights queries
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Weekly digest ARN not configured"
Old Lambda code. Run: `bun run update:aws`

### High OpenAI costs
Reduce `MAX_EMAILS_PER_RUN` or disable optional agents

### Gmail rate limits
Already handled with batching, but can adjust `GMAIL_BATCH_DELAY_MS`

### TypeScript build errors
Use `async function<T>()` not arrow functions for generics

## Visual Development

### Indie Design Philosophy
**REMEMBER: We're shipping to validate, not win design awards.**
- Good enough UX that doesn't frustrate users
- Clean, professional look without obsessing over pixels
- Focus on the money feature working beautifully (the digest email)
- Everything else just needs to not be broken

### Frontend Location
The frontend code is located in the `/frontend` directory - all UI/UX work happens there.

### Quick Visual Check
After implementing any front-end change in `/frontend`:
1. **Does it work?** - Test the actual functionality
2. **Does it look broken?** - Quick visual scan for obvious issues
3. **Is it usable?** - Can users figure it out without instructions?
4. **Take a screenshot** - Document what shipped
5. **Check console** - No errors breaking the experience

### When to Care More About Design
- The money feature (beautiful digest emails)
- First-time user experience/onboarding
- Dashboard for viewing/managing digests
- Error states that lose user trust

### Design Principles
- `/context/design-principles.md` - Pragmatic design checklist
- `/context/style-guide.md` - Basic brand consistency for frontend
- Use these as guidelines, not gospel

### Design Review (When Needed)
Use the design-review agent when:
- Shipping a major user-facing feature in `/frontend`
- The UI feels "off" and you need help
- Before a Product Hunt launch
- Customer reported UI/UX issues

Remember: Ship first, polish based on user feedback.

## Remember

**This is a working product that delivers value.** The code isn't perfect, but it:
- Processes emails reliably
- Saves users hours per week
- Costs < $5/month to run
- Has room to grow to 10K+ users

**Focus on**: Making the money feature bulletproof, fixing security issues, then shipping features users ask for.

**Ignore**: Enterprise patterns, perfect test coverage, complex architectures.

**Ship fast, get feedback, iterate.** You're building a business, not writing a computer science textbook.
